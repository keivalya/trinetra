# trinetra


## Problem
Visually impaired people face many challenges in their day to day life which are very convenient for others. As they might say, sidewalks can be the most dangerous of places. One of the consequences of vision loss is being uncomfortable about safety while moving around or traveling independently. Safe navigation on sidewalks is the most important requirement.

## Solution Proposed
In order so solve this, we can develop a hardware as well as software solution.
- Trinetra headband: Raspberry Pi embedded  with Tensorflow to detect objects in the surroundings

- A simple Web Application which uses the device in your hand, a smartphone to read your surroundings for you. We implemented it just in case if people somehow canâ€™t access our hardware.<br>

## Inspiration


## Tech Stack Used
We will be using, OR have used:
- Raspberry Pi 4B module for ML Model training and deployment
- Pi Cam is a feasible option to capture images
- Lipo battery is light weight and easily chargable

For Web-App
- ReactJS
- TensorFlow 2.0
- react-WebCam
- CocoSSD

## Future of trinetra
We are planning on building more accurate ML model and implement a better hardware solution. On duscussing upon the same last night, we came up with the idea of a Kotlin Application which will not only assist a person through the surrounding environment, but also within their device.
